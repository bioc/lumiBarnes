Description: The Barnes benchmark dataset can be used  to evaluate the algorithms for Illumina microarrays. It measured a titration series of two human tissues, blood and placenta, and includes six samples with the titration ratio of blood and placenta as 100:0, 95:5, 75:25, 50:50, 25:75 and 0:100. The samples were hybridized on HumanRef-8 BeadChip (Illumina, Inc) in duplicate. The data is loaded as an LumiBatch Object (see documents in the lumi package).
